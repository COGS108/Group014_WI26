    "The relationship between sleep hygiene and academic success is a cornerstone of student health research. \n",
    "University students often experience a \"sleep debt\" due to high cognitive demands and the biological \n",
    "tendency for delayed sleep phases in young adults. Research indicates that sleep is not merely a passive \n",
    "state of rest but an active period for memory consolidation, where the hippocampus and neocortex interact \n",
    "to solidify information acquired during the day.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",
    "When students drop below the recommended threshold of rest, they risk impairing executive functions, \n",
    "including attention span and decision-making capabilities, which are vital for maintaining a high CGPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine emphasizes that for college students, getting enough sleep is vital for academic success, noting that sleep-deprived students are more likely to experience lower grades and a decrease in overall performance.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)While many students prioritize \"all-nighter\" study sessions, data consistently shows that consistent, long-duration sleep provides a much stronger foundation for long-term retention and academic endurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, large-scale longitudinal studies have demonstrated that sleep quality, duration, and consistency are all significantly related to academic performance in college. Specifically, students who maintain a regular sleep schedule and average over seven hours of rest tend to have significantly higher GPAs than those with irregular or short-duration sleep patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)  This suggests that the quality and quantity of rest may be a more powerful predictor of success than the sheer volume of study hours completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis on student lifestyle data, we aim to verify if a 7-hour threshold results in a statistically significant difference in CGPA. Organizations like the Sleep Foundation have historically tracked how sleep affects school reports, providing a baseline that suggests a clear drop-off in academic metrics when students fall into the \"insufficient sleep\" category.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)  Our project builds on this by specifically isolating the 7-hour variable to provide an unambiguous answer to how rest influences academic standing.\n",

    "We predict that there will be a **large, statistically significant, and positive** difference in the average CGPA of university students who report sleeping 7+ hours per night compared to the average CGPA of university students who report sleeping less than 7 hours per night. We believe that students who have more sleep will likely be more alert in the classes they take, and as a result will receive higher scores on homework assignments and exams, on average. This means we would expect their CGPAs to be greater compared to students who sleep less."

    "### CMU Student Sleep and Academic Performance Dataset\n",
    "The CMU dataset contains data collected from Fitbits about Carnegie Mellon University students' sleep habits and academic performances. Each row represents one student during one academic term. The dataset compares sleep habits to the students' GPAs. \n",
    "- The important metrics are:\n",
    "    - `Zterm_units_ZofZ`: The standaradized Z-score changes these course loads from the term_units variable releative to the student's peers.\n",
    "    - `cum_gpa`: Cumulative GPA represents the student's overall academic standing throughout their academic history. This is measured on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale.\n",
    "    - `term_gpa`: Term GPA represents the student's overall performance during a specific semester. This is measured on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale.\n",
    "    - `bedtime_mssd`: Measured in square hours. This represents the variability in the students' bedtimes across nights. The larger the value, the more irregular the sleep timing. The higher the variability, the worse cognitive performance and mood regulation there is among students.\n",
    "    - `TotalSleepTime`: Measured in minutes per night. Represents the total average time each student sleeps during the night in the term. Values that are below 360 minutes show short sleep which is connected with low cognitive performance, mood regulation, and poorer academic performances as well.\n",
    "    - `daytime_sleep`: Measured in minutes per day. Represents the time spent sleeping in the day/napping. High daytime sleep can imply bad nighttime sleep, while moderate daytime sleep can make up for bad nighttime sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
    "5. Feel free to add more cells here if that's helpful for you\n"
