    "The relationship between sleep hygiene and academic success is a cornerstone of student health research. \n",
    "University students often experience a \"sleep debt\" due to high cognitive demands and the biological \n",
    "tendency for delayed sleep phases in young adults. Research indicates that sleep is not merely a passive \n",
    "state of rest but an active period for memory consolidation, where the hippocampus and neocortex interact \n",
    "to solidify information acquired during the day.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) \n",
    "When students drop below the recommended threshold of rest, they risk impairing executive functions, \n",
    "including attention span and decision-making capabilities, which are vital for maintaining a high CGPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine emphasizes that for college students, getting enough sleep is vital for academic success, noting that sleep-deprived students are more likely to experience lower grades and a decrease in overall performance.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)While many students prioritize \"all-nighter\" study sessions, data consistently shows that consistent, long-duration sleep provides a much stronger foundation for long-term retention and academic endurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, large-scale longitudinal studies have demonstrated that sleep quality, duration, and consistency are all significantly related to academic performance in college. Specifically, students who maintain a regular sleep schedule and average over seven hours of rest tend to have significantly higher GPAs than those with irregular or short-duration sleep patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)  This suggests that the quality and quantity of rest may be a more powerful predictor of success than the sheer volume of study hours completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis on student lifestyle data, we aim to verify if a 7-hour threshold results in a statistically significant difference in CGPA. Organizations like the Sleep Foundation have historically tracked how sleep affects school reports, providing a baseline that suggests a clear drop-off in academic metrics when students fall into the \"insufficient sleep\" category.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)  Our project builds on this by specifically isolating the 7-hour variable to provide an unambiguous answer to how rest influences academic standing.\n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that there will be a **large, statistically significant, and positive** difference in the average CGPA of university students who report sleeping 7+ hours per night compared to the average CGPA of university students who report sleeping less than 7 hours per night. We believe that students who have more sleep will likely be more alert in the classes they take, and as a result will receive higher scores on homework assignments and exams, on average. This means we would expect their CGPAs to be greater compared to students who sleep less."

    "The ideal dataset should be a tidy dataset with rows where the unit-of-analysis is a single student. There should be variables for the dependent variable (the CGPA of a student at the time of the study) and the independent variables (the number of hours of sleep a student received). We ideally should have at least 500 observations since we should expect that more students should sleep closer to about 4-8 hours; this means that the sample size of those who either sleep below or above this amount would be smaller and thus having a larger sample size would probably alleviate those concerns. Ideally, if we were to use the number of hours a student slept as our main independent variable, we should probably have at least 30 students for each hour. We think that the best way to collect this data (considering the costs) would probably be having students wear some sort of watch that tracks the number of hours they sleep per night. This allows us to accurately record the number of hours of sleep for each student, but they would still have to record their CGPA. We would probably use a survey to collect this data, even if it might introduce some measurement error (some students may not want to report a lower GPA out of embarrassment). We could organize the dataset as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CMU Sleep dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/cmu-sleep) has data on 634 students from three different universities who wore a FitBit watch to record their hours of sleep per day, which is a reliable method of accurately measuring sleep compared to our idealized data. The variables recorded include the reported hours of sleep each student received, a binary variable indicating whether the student identifies as part of an underrepresented group, the gender of the student, whether the student is a first-generation college attendee, and several measures of sleep time (mean successive squared difference of bedtime and total sleep time). There are also variables for the student's cumulative GPA and their term GPA, along with the number of units they took for the term in question. The CMU sleep dataset is probably one of the most comprehensive datasets we could use; not only does it have the dependent and independent variables we identified and our operationalized definitions of each variable, it also includes standardized versions of our dependent and independent variables that we had not identified at first.\n",

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we use a public dataset, the data will be anonymized. Participants who choose to share their data will have the option to opt out or choose to keep their information anonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have considered certain sources of bias like asking certain majors with more rigorous classes. To mitigate these, we will ask a variety of people and get a diverse group of responses. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will not collect information not relevant to analysis, such as names, student PIDs, or any contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data will be stored locally on password-protected devices, which are only to be accessed by our group. No personal information will be stored, which will reduce security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset will only be used for the project and will be deleted afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We know the blindspots that exist within our dataset, which will be discussed in the discussion section.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will examine the dataset for imbalances in sleep categories that are caused by certain variables not addressed in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed will honestly represent the underlying data. We will choose accurate representations to avoid invalid interpretations. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No PII will be displayed in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will keep a separate notebook to allow the results to be reproducible if we come across issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will not use variables that act as proxies that are unfairly discriminatory when modeling our project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We acknowledge that the results may not be perfectly equal for all students due to unobserved variables. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will not rely on a single metric for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We use simple statistical methods that are easy to understand. This will make it easy to understand our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We clearly explain the limitations of our analysis, including the use of self-reported data and possibility of factors that affect CGPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
