    "\n",
    "> If we use a public dataset, the data will be anonymized. Participants who choose to share their data will have the option to opt out or choose to keep their information anonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have considered certain sources of bias like asking certain majors with more rigorous classes. To mitigate these, we will ask a variety of people and get a diverse group of responses. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will not collect information not relevant to analysis, such as names, student PIDs, or any contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data will be stored locally on password-protected devices, which are only to be accessed by our group. No personal information will be stored, which will reduce security risks.\n",

    "> The dataset will only be used for the project and will be deleted afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "> We know the blindspots that exist within our dataset, which will be discussed in the discussion section.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> We will examine the dataset for imbalances in sleep categories that are caused by certain variables not addressed in the data.\n",

    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No PII will be displayed in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will keep a separate notebook to allow the results to be reproducible if we come across issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will not use variables that act as proxies that are unfairly discriminatory when modeling our project.\n",

    "\n",
    "> We acknowledge that the results may not be perfectly equal for all students due to unobserved variables. \n",

    "\n",
    "> We will not rely on a single metric for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We use simple statistical methods that are easy to understand. This will make it easy to understand our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We clearly explain the limitations of our analysis, including the use of self-reported data and possibility of factors that affect CGPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
